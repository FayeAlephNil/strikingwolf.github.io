{"name":"About Me","tagline":"","body":"# IRL\r\n\r\nI am a high school student currently exploring what the hell I'm going to do\r\n\r\n# Online\r\n\r\nI am primarily a programmer who initially interacted with the MC community, but I have now spread my horizons.\r\n\r\n## Programming\r\n\r\nI am a functional programmer and I really like these languages\r\n* Rust\r\n* Clojure\r\n* Scala\r\n\r\n## Where I can be found\r\n\r\nI'm usually on irc.esper.net and if I am not then you can contact me at [twitter via @strikingwolf14](http://twitter.com/strikingwolf14), via [my github account](https://github.com/Strikingwolf), or [my FTB forums account](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/members/strikingwolf.86174/)\r\n\r\n## Current Projects\r\n\r\nI'm currently sketching out some plans for a word graph web application. These plans/ideas can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/Strikingwolf/fe762bef8c756695d4ae)\r\n\r\n## Affiliations\r\n\r\nI am affiliated with the Phoenix Team, AHN, and Temporal Reality. These three groups are filled with great people. and they have really helped me grow both as a person but also as a programmer.\r\n\r\n# Interests\r\n\r\nBesides programming I have a couple other interests fueled by either online discussion or my IRL experiences\r\n\r\n## Philosophy\r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of philosophy, and I have been working on a philosophical theory based on the concept of discrete time. I am currently formalizing this theory and it will eventually be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Strikingwolf/025adcc6131a64189111)\r\n\r\n## Math\r\n\r\nI am also very interested in math. This has been fueled by many hours of watching youtube videos by Vi Hart, Numberphile, and others and by programming different mathematical concepts I find interesting. Currently I am interested in formal mathematics and its ancestor formal logic\r\n\r\n## Game Design\r\n\r\nI love learning about game design, primarily from the folks on the youtube channel Extra Credits. I'm extremely interested in how we can use our design expertise to capture the attention of a player so massively.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
